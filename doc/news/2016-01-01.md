This release adds support for the `process_info` Python hook.  This hook
provides a powerful way to assist in templating. Basically, it provides full
Python power to inspect, verify, modify, and add page attributes. For example,
you can use it to define a default `layout`, or a specific `layout` 
for pages in a certain directory.
