title: How to preview sites that use the baseurl option?

The `urubu serve` server does not include the `baseurl` prefix when serving
pages so sites that use `baseurl` can't be previewed locally using
`urubu serve`.
An alternative option is to use
[tservice](https://github.com/jiffyclub/tservice), which includes
an option to serve a local static site with a URL prefix.
To use tservice with an Urubu site instead of using `urubu serve`
call `tserve` with the prefix option, e.g.

```
tserve --prefix baseurl _build
```

Where "baseurl" is your site's particular prefix.
